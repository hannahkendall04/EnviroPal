# EnviroPal

Want to do something to better the world around you but don't know where to start? Life got you feeling like you need to reconnect with nature but don't know how? You're in the right place! EnviroPal is a native mobile app, built with React Native's Expo.js framework that aims to inspire and empower people to connect with nature. EnviroPal uses Google's Gemini API to generate two kinds of projects for users to complete: Go Green and Touch Grass. Go Green projects aim to guide users to take actions to help the environment, a feat that is incredibly important in our day and age. Touch Grass projects are geared towards nature-based self care for users, because there is nothing better for the soul than a good environmetally-based factory reset!

EnviroPal was a project for LA Hacks 2024, whcih was also my first Hacakthon. I had a lot more fun with this project, and the hackathon, than I was expecting and it gave me a very enjoyable day of productive procrastination.
